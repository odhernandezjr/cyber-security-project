Shuffle Configuration for Windows
1. Create a New Workflow
Open Shuffle and create a new workflow.
Search for Webhook in the Triggers section and add it to the workflow.
Name the workflow and copy the Webhook URI.
2. Configure Webhook in Wazuh Manager
Open the Wazuh Manager's configuration file: /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf.
Paste the Webhook URI into the <ossec_config> section.
Ensure the integration tag matches the formatting of other tags.
Maintain consistent spacing as in the existing configuration.
Set the <hook_url> tag to the copied Shuffle Webhook URI.
Adjust the <level> tag:
Set it to a specific rule ID for this project: <rule_id>100002</rule_id>.
This ensures only alerts matching the rule are sent to Shuffle.
Restart the Wazuh Manager service to apply changes.
3. Trigger Workflow
Log in to the Windows Server 2019 instance.
Execute the Mimikatz file to generate an alert.
Check Shuffle:
Click the running man icon at the bottom of the page to see the triggered alert.
Test the workflow by reviewing the Webhook Event and inspecting Execution Arguments for details sent by Wazuh.
4. Parse Alert Data
Click the Change Me icon in Shuffle.
Update the action:
Replace Repeat Back to Me with Regex Capture Group.
Under Input Data:
Add a new field by clicking the + button and select Hash from the execution arguments.
Use this to parse the SHA-256 hash from the alert data.
Use Regex:
Extract the SHA-256 hash using a regular expression. If needed, generate the regex by pasting the SHA-256 string into a tool like ChatGPT.
5. Validate Workflow
Click the Show Executions button and refresh the workflow.
Expand the results to verify the parsed hash is accurate.
6. Add VirusTotal Integration
Search for VirusTotal in the Shuffle application list and add it to the workflow.
After the SHA-256 regex step, configure VirusTotal:
Wait for actions to populate and select Get a Hash Report.
Authenticate by pasting your VirusTotal API key.
Update the API request:
Modify the /reports? endpoint to /{ID} as specified in VirusTotal's documentation:
Fork the VirusTotal app:
Open the app settings and click Fork to create a customizable version.
Under the GET action for hash reports, update the URL path from /files/report? to /{ID}.
Submit and save the changes to the forked app.
Run the workflow again to verify VirusTotal results:
Check results under results/body/data/attributes/last_analysis_stats to review findings (e.g., harmless, malicious).
7. Add TheHive Integration
Add TheHive to the workflow after the VirusTotal step.

Authenticate:

Paste your TheHive API key and enter the public IP and port (9000) for your instance.
Populate alert fields:

Date: Use the utcTime execution argument to timestamp the alert.
Description: Example:
Mimikatz detected on host: <field: computer> by user: <field: user>.
Severity: Set to 2.
Source: Specify Wazuh.
Tags: Use relevant tags, e.g., ["T1003", "Credential Dumping"].
Title: Include field-based details, such as hostname and process ID.
Ensure the firewall allows inbound IPv4 traffic on port 9000.

8. Add Email Notifications
Include the Email application in the workflow.
Configure email details:
Recipient: Enter the desired email address.
Subject: For example, Mimikatz Detected.
Body: Use field-based data to include alert details.
