For this project, create two users: one for yourself and one for API access.

Follow the steps below for user creation details:
  User Details:
    Type:
      First user: normal
      Second user (for API): service
    Login:
      First user: <name>@test.com
      Second user: shuffle@test.com
  Name:
      First user: <name>
      Second user: SOAR
  Profile:
      First user: analyst
      Second user: While a custom profile should follow the principle of least privilege, for now, assign analyst.
      Set Passwords:

Hover over the <name> account, click on the account, and select Set a New Password.
For the shuffle account, also generate an API key:
Navigate to the account settings for shuffle.
Generate and copy the API key.
Save the API key securely for future use (e.g., during Shuffle configuration). Avoid misplacing the key to prevent unauthorized use.

Log in to the <name> Account
Use the credentials created for the <name> account to log in to TheHive.
